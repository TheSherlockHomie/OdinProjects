# Rock, Paper, Scissors

This was made as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com)'s project in the chapter [Web Development 101](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101).

The project's problem page is [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/rock-paper-scissors).

I tried to make the website look beautiful too, apart from making the game.
The website is not responsive, and only supports desktop browsers as it is not possible to play this on mobile anyway.
